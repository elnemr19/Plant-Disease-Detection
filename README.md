# Plant-Disease-Detection
## 1. Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify Plant Diseases and predict the true class. We will use simple convolutional neural networks (CNNs), EfficientNet, ResNet, and VGG19 to train our models, as they have been shown to be effective in image classification tasks. the data contain 38 classes of plant disease.
